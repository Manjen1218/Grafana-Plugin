2. Within the file `server.js`, replace the current `HOST`, `PORT` values with your own settings.
2. WIthin the file `server.js`, fill in your own database config for functional sql connection.
2. Run `node server.js`

Now in your terminal you should see `API running at http://<YOUR_HOST>:<YOUR_PORT>`, indicating your service is now loaded and ready.
